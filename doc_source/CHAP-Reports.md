# Creating conversion reports<a name="CHAP-Reports"></a>

When you are planning a database conversion, it is helpful to create some reports to help you understand what is involved\. You can create reports using AWS Schema Conversion Tool\.

You can use AWS SCT to create a database migration assessment report\. With this report, you get a summary of your schema conversion tasks and the details for items that can't be automatically converted to your target database\. You can use this report to evaluate how much of the project can be completed by using AWS SCT, and what else you need to complete the conversion\. To create an assessment report, use **Create Report** from the context \(right\-click\) menu of the database in AWS SCT\.
