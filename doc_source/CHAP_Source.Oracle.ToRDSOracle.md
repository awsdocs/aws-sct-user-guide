# Converting Oracle to Amazon RDS for Oracle<a name="CHAP_Source.Oracle.ToRDSOracle"></a>

Some things to consider when migrating Oracle schema and code to Amazon RDS for Oracle: 
+ AWS SCT can add directory objects to the object tree\. Directory objects are logical structures that each represent a physical directory on the server's file system\. You can use directory objects with packages such as DBMS\_LOB, UTL\_FILE, DBMS\_FILE\_TRANSFER, the DATAPUMP utility, and so on\.
+ AWS SCT supports converting Oracle tablespaces to an Amazon RDS for Oracle DB instance\. Oracle stores data logically in tablespaces and physically in data files associated with the corresponding tablespace\. In Oracle you can create tablespace with data file names\. Amazon RDS supports Oracle Managed Files \(OMF\) for data files, log files and control files only\. AWS SCT creates the needed data files during conversion\.
+ AWS SCT can convert server\-level roles and privileges\. The Oracle database engine uses role\-based security\. A role is a collection of privileges that you can grant to or revoke from a user\. A predefined role in Amazon RDS, called DBA, normally allows all administrative privileges on an Oracle database engine\. The following privileges are not available for the DBA role on an Amazon RDS DB instance using the Oracle engine:
  + Alter database
  + Alter system
  + Create any directory
  + Grant any privilege
  + Grant any role
  + Create external job

  You can grant all other privileges to an Amazon RDS for Oracle user role, including advanced filtering and column privileges\.
+ AWS SCT supports converting Oracle jobs into jobs that can run on Amazon RDS for Oracle\. There are a few limitations to the conversion, including the following:
  + Executable jobs are not supported\.
  + Schedule jobs that use the ANYDATA data type as an argument are not supported\.
+ Oracle Real Application Clusters \(RAC\) One Node is an option to the Oracle Database Enterprise Edition that was introduced with Oracle Database 11g Release 2\. Amazon RDS for Oracle doesn’t support the RAC feature\. For high availability, use Amazon RDS Multi\-AZ\. 

  In a Multi\-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone\. The primary DB instance is synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to a standby replica\. This functionality provides data redundancy, eliminates I/O freezes, and minimizes latency spikes during system backups\.
+ Oracle Spatial provides a SQL schema and functions that facilitate the storage, retrieval, update, and query of collections of spatial data in an Oracle database\. Oracle Locator provides capabilities that are typically required to support internet and wireless service\-based applications and partner\-based GIS solutions\. Oracle Locator is a limited subset of Oracle Spatial\.

  To use Oracle Spatial and Oracle Locator features you must add the SPATIAL option or LOCATOR option \( mutually exclusive\) to the option group of your DB instance\.

  There are some prerequisites to using Oracle Spatial and Oracle Locator on an Amazon RDS for Oracle DB instance:
  + The instance should use Oracle Enterprise Edition version 12\.1\.0\.2\.v6 or later, or 11\.2\.0\.4\.v10 or later\.
  + The instance should be inside a virtual private cloud \(VPC\)\.
  + The instance should the DB instance class that can support the Oracle feature\. For example, Oracle Spatial is not supported for the db\.m1\.small, db\.t1\.micro, db\.t2\.micro, or db\.t2\.small DB instance classes\. For more information, see [ DB Instance Class Support for Oracle ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/CHAP_Oracle.html#Oracle.Concepts.InstanceClasses)\.
  + The instance must have the Auto Minor Version Upgrade option enabled\. Amazon RDS updates your DB instance to the latest Oracle PSU if there are security vulnerabilities with a CVSS score of 9\+ or other announced security vulnerabilities\. For more information, see 

    [ Settings for Oracle DB Instances ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/USER_ModifyInstance.Oracle.html#USER_ModifyInstance.Oracle.Settings)\.
  + If your DB instance is version 11\.2\.0\.4\.v10 or later, you must install the XMLDB option\. For more information, see

    [ Oracle XML DB ](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.Options.XMLDB.html)\.
  + You should have an Oracle Spatial license from Oracle\. For more information, see [ Oracle Spatial and Graph ](https://shop.oracle.com/apex/product?p1=OracleSpatialandGraph) in the Oracle documentation\.
+ Data Guard is included with Oracle Database Enterprise Edition\. Amazon RDS for Oracle doesn’t support Data Guard and Active Data Guard\. For high availability, use Amazon RDS Multi\-AZ feature\. 

  In a Multi\-AZ deployment, Amazon RDS automatically provisions and maintains a synchronous standby replica in a different Availability Zone\. The primary DB instance is synchronously replicated across Availability Zones to a standby replica\. This functionality provides data redundancy, eliminates I/O freezes, and minimizes latency spikes during system backups\.
+ AWS SCT supports converting Oracle DBMS\_SCHEDULER objects when migrating to Amazon RDS for Oracle\. The AWS SCT assessment report indicates if a schedule object can be converted\. For more information on using schedule objects with Amazon RDS, see the [Amazon RDS documentation](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.System.html#Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.ModifyScheduler)\.
+ For Oracle to Amazon RDS for Oracle conversions, DB Links is supported\. A database link is a schema object in one database that enables you to access objects on another database\. The other database doesn’t need to be an Oracle database\. However, to access non\-Oracle databases you must use Oracle Heterogeneous Services\.

  Once you create a database link, you can use the link in SQL statements to refer to tables, views, and PL/SQL objects in the other database\. To use a database link, append `@dblink` to the table, view, or PL/SQL object name\. You can query a table or view in the other database with the SELECT statement\. For more information about using Oracle database links, see the [ Oracle documentation ](https://docs.oracle.com/cd/B28359_01/server.111/b28310/ds_concepts002.htm#ADMIN12083)\.

  For more information about using database links with Amazon RDS, see the [ Amazon RDS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.Database.html#Appendix.Oracle.CommonDBATasks.DBLinks)\.
+  The AWS SCT assessment report provides server metrics for the conversion\. These metrics about your Oracle instance include the following:
  + Computation and memory capacity of the target DB instance\.
  + Unsupported Oracle features such as Data Guard, Unified Auditing, and Real Application Clusters that Amazon RDS doesn't support\.
  + Disk read\-write load
  + Average total disk throughput
  + Server information such as server name, OS, host name, and character set\.

## Limitations When Converting Oracle to Amazon RDS for Oracle<a name="CHAP_Source.Oracle.ToRDSOracle.Limitations"></a>

Some limitations you should consider when migrating Oracle schema and code to Amazon RDS for Oracle: 
+  A predefined role in Amazon RDS, called DBA, normally allows all administrative privileges on an Oracle database engine\. The following privileges are not available for the DBA role on an Amazon RDS DB instance using the Oracle engine:
  + Alter database
  + Alter system
  + Create any directory
  + Grant any privilege
  + Grant any role
  + Create external job

  You can grant all other privileges to an Oracle RDS user role\.
+ Amazon RDS for Oracle doesn’t support Oracle Unified Auditing\. Amazon RDS for Oracle supports traditional auditing and fine\-grained auditing using the DBMS\_FGA package\.
+ Amazon RDS for Oracle doesn’t support change data capture \(CDC\)\. To do CDC during and after a database migration, use AWS Database Migration Service\.
