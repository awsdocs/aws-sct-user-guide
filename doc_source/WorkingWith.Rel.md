You can use the AWS Schema Conversion Tool \(AWS SCT\) to convert your existing database schema from one database engine to another\. Your converted schema is suitable for Amazon Relational Database Service \(Amazon RDS\)\. 

You can also use AWS SCT to copy your existing on\-premises database schema to an Amazon RDS DB instance running the same engine\. You can use this feature to analyze potential cost savings of moving to the cloud and of changing your license type\. 

In some cases, database features can't be converted to equivalent Amazon RDS features\. If you host and self\-manage a database on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud \(Amazon EC2\) platform, you can emulate these features by substituting AWS services for them\. 

Following, you can find more information about these processes\.
