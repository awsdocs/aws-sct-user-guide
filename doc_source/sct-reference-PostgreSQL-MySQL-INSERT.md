## Issue 6172: MySQL doesn't support the INSERT statement with the RETURNING option<a name="sct-reference-6172"></a>

To convert this operation, change the INSERT statement with the RETURNING clause into an INSERT statement with following SELECT statements, and use the same key conditions in each SELECT\. You can also use the last value that was generated by any AUTO\_INCREMENT column in the key condition\.
