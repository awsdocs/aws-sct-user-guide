# Troubleshooting issues with AWS SCT<a name="CHAP_Troubleshooting"></a>

Following, you can find information about troubleshooting issues with the AWS Schema Conversion Tool \(AWS SCT\)\.

## Cannot load objects from an Oracle source database<a name="CHAP_Troubleshooting.OracleLoad"></a>

When you attempt to load schema from an Oracle database, you might encounter one of the following errors\.

```
Cannot load objects tree.
```

```
ORA-00942: table or view does not exist
```

These errors occur because the user whose ID you used to connect to the Oracle database doesn't have sufficient permissions to read the schema, as required by AWS SCT\. 

You can resolve the issue by granting the user `select_catalog_role` permission and also permission to any dictionary in the database\. These permissions provide the read\-only access to the views and system tables that is required by AWS SCT\. The following example creates a user ID named `min_privs` and grants the user with this ID the minimum permissions required to convert schema from an Oracle source database\. 

```
create user min_privs identified by min_privs;
grant connect to min_privs;
grant select_catalog_role to min_privs;  
grant select any dictionary to min_privs;
```

## Assessment report warning message<a name="CHAP_Troubleshooting.WarningMessage"></a>

To assess the complexity of converting to another database engine, AWS SCT requires access to objects in your source database\. When AWS SCT encounters problems during scanning and can’t perform an assessment, a warning message is issued\. This message indicates that the overall conversion percentage is reduced\. Following are reasons why AWS SCT might encounter problems during scanning:
+ Your database user doesn’t have access to all of the needed objects\. For more information about AWS SCT required security permissions and privileges for your database, see [Sources for AWS SCT](CHAP_Source.md) for the appropriate source database section in this guide\.
+ An object cited in the schema no longer exists in the database\. To help resolve the issue, you can connect with SYSDBA permissions and check if the object is present in the database\. 
+ SCT is trying to assess an object that is encrypted\.
