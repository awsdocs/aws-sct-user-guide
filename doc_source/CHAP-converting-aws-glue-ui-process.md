# Converting using AWS Glue in the AWS SCT<a name="CHAP-converting-aws-glue-ui-process"></a>

Following, you can find an outline of the process to convert ETL using AWS Glue with AWS SCT\. For this example, we convert an Oracle database to Amazon Redshift, along with the ETL processes used with the source databases and data warehouses\.

## Step 1: Create a new project<a name="CHAP-converting-aws-glue-step-ui-new-project"></a>

To create a new project, take these high\-level steps:

1. Create a new project in the AWS SCT\. For more information, see [Creating an AWS SCT project](CHAP_UserInterface.md#CHAP_UserInterface.Project)\. 

1. Add your source and target databases to the project\. For more information, see [Adding database servers to an AWS SCT project](CHAP_UserInterface.md#CHAP_UserInterface.AddServers)\.

   Make sure that you have chosen **Use AWS Glue** in the target database connection settings\. Choose the **AWS Glue** tab\. For **Copy from AWS profile**, choose the profile that you want to use\. The profile should automatically fill in the AWS access key, secret key, and Amazon S3 bucket folder\. If it doesn't, enter this information yourself\. After you choose **OK**, AWS Glue analyzes the objects and loads metadata into the AWS Glue Data Catalog\. 

   Depending on your security settings, you might get a warning message that says your account doesn't have sufficient privileges for some of the schemas on the server\. If you have access to the schemas that you're using, you can safely ignore this message\.

1. To finish preparing to import your ETL, connect to your source and target databases\. To do so, choose your database in the source or target metadata tree and then choose **Connect to the server**\.

AWS Glue creates a database on the source database server and also on the target database server to help with the ETL conversion\. The database on the target server contains the AWS Glue Data Catalog\. To find specific objects, use search on the source or target panels\.

To see how a specific object converts, find an item you want to convert, and choose **Convert schema** from its context \(right\-click\) menu\. AWS SCT transforms this selected object into a script\.

You can review the converted script from the **Scripts** folder in the right panel\. Currently, the script is a virtual object, which is available only as part of your AWS SCT project\.

 To create an AWS Glue job with your converted script, upload your script to Amazon S3\. To upload the script to Amazon S3, choose the script, then choose **Save to S3** from its context \(right\-click\) menu\.

## Step 2: Create an AWS Glue job<a name="CHAP-converting-aws-glue-step-ui-config-job"></a>

After you save the script to Amazon S3, you can choose it and then choose **Configure AWS Glue Job** to open the wizard to configure the AWS Glue job\. The wizard makes it easier to set this up: 

1. On the first tab of the wizard, **Design Data Flow**, you can choose an execution strategy and the list of scripts you want to include in this one job\. You can choose parameters for each script\. You can also rearrange the scripts so that they run in the correct order\.

1. On the second tab, you can name your job, and directly configure settings for AWS Glue\. On this screen, you can configure the following settings:
   + AWS Identity and Access Management \(IAM\) role
   + Script file names and file paths
   + Encrypt the script using server\-side encryption with Amazon S3â€“managed keys \(SSE\-S3\)
   + Temporary directory
   + Generated Python library path
   + User Python library path
   + Path for the dependent \.jar files
   + Referenced files path
   + Concurrent DPUs for each job run
   + Maximum concurrency
   + Job timeout \(in minutes\)
   + Delay notification threshold \(in minutes\)
   + Number of retries
   + Security configuration
   + Server\-side encryption

1. On the third step, or tab, you choose the configured connection to the target endpoint\. 

After you finish configuring the job, it displays under the ETL jobs in the AWS Glue Data Catalog\. If you choose the job, the settings display so you can review or edit them\. To create a new job in AWS Glue, choose **Create AWS Glue Job** from the context \(right\-click\) menu for the job\. Doing this applies the schema definition\. To refresh the display, choose **Refresh from database** from the context \(right\-click\) menu\. 

At this point, you can view your job in the AWS Glue console\. To do so, sign in to the AWS Management Console and open the AWS Glue console at [https://console\.aws\.amazon\.com/glue/](https://console.aws.amazon.com/glue/)\.

You can test the new job to make sure that it's working correctly\. To do so, first check the data in your source table, then verify that the target table is empty\. Run the job, and check again\. You can view error logs from the AWS Glue console\.
