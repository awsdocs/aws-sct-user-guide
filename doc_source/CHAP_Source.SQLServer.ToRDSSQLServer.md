# Converting SQL Server to Amazon RDS for SQL Server<a name="CHAP_Source.SQLServer.ToRDSSQLServer"></a>

Some things to consider when migrating SQL Server schema and code to Amazon RDS for SQL Server: 
+ AWS SCT can convert SQL Server Agent to provide schedules, alerts, and jobs on an Amazon RDS for SQL Server DB instance\. After conversion, you can use an Amazon RDS for SQL Server DB instance with SQL Server Reporting Services \(SSRS\), SQL Server Analysis Services \(SSAS\), and SQL Server Integration Services \(SSIS\)\.
+ Amazon RDS currently doesnâ€™t support SQL Server Service Broker or additional T\-SQL endpoints that require you to run the CREATE ENDPOINT command\.
+ Amazon RDS has limited support for linked servers\. When converting SQL Server application code that uses linked servers, AWS SCT converts the application code\. However, make sure to review the behavior of objects that use linked servers before you run the converted code\.
+ Always on is used\.
+ The AWS SCT assessment report provides server metrics for the conversion\. These metrics about your SQL Server instance include the following:
  + Data mirroring is used\.
  + SQL Server Log Shipping is configured\.
  + Failover cluster is used\.
  + Database Mail is configured\. 
  + Full Text Search Service is used\. Amazon RDS for SQL Server has a limited full text search, and it does not support semantic search\.
  + Data Quality Service \(DQS\) is installed\. Amazon RDS doesn't support DQS so we recommend that you install SQL Server on an Amazon EC2 instance\.

## Privileges for RDS for SQL Server as a target<a name="CHAP_Source.SQLServer.ToRDSSQLServer.ConfigureTarget"></a>

To migrate to RDS for SQL Server, create a database user and then grant the required privileges for each database\. You can use the following code example\.

```
CREATE LOGIN user_name WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';
                
USE db_name
CREATE USER user_name FOR LOGIN user_name
GRANT VIEW DEFINITION TO user_name
GRANT VIEW DATABASE STATE TO user_name
GRANT CREATE SCHEMA TO user_name;
GRANT CREATE TABLE TO user_name;
GRANT CREATE VIEW TO user_name;
GRANT CREATE TYPE TO user_name;
GRANT CREATE DEFAULT TO user_name;
GRANT CREATE FUNCTION TO user_name;
GRANT CREATE PROCEDURE TO user_name;
GRANT CREATE ASSEMBLY TO user_name;
GRANT CREATE AGGREGATE TO user_name;
GRANT CREATE FULLTEXT CATALOG TO user_name;
GRANT CREATE SYNONYM TO user_name;
GRANT CREATE XML SCHEMA COLLECTION TO user_name;
```

In the preceding example, replace *user\_name* with the name of your user\. Then, replace *db\_name* with the name of your target database\. Finally, replace *your\_password* with a secure password\.
